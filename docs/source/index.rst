CONAN - User Guide
===================================

**CONAN** is a tool to generate carbon and boron nitride structures, set up MD simulation boxes, generate xyz structures from a provided trajectory and analyze MD trajectories composed of a liquid in confinement.
The program has the following features:

* Generate structures such as carbon walls, carbon nanotubes (CNT), pore structures, and their boron nitride analogues. All carbon structures can be doped with graphitic nitrogen.
* Set up simulation boxes with a bulk liquid input file and carbon structures of choice.
* Identify and characterize solid structures found in an MD trajectory.
* Calculate the radial density within a CNT/pore, either weighted by mass or by partial charge.
* Calculate the accessible volume of a CNT/pore.
* Calculate the axial density along a simulation box.
* Cut a pore/CNT from the trajectory, either filled with liquid or empty.

In addition, the program includes a molecular identification tool, which makes it possible to perform all analyses for the individual types of molecules present in the system or even individual atoms.
